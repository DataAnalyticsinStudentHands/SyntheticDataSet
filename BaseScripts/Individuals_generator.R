#re-cast small cells to be more plausible
#get groupings for tracts by larger categories from the HCAD_b4_expand (save as an RDS from other)
#maybe some financial stuff to get a direction?? look at what's available... Brownfields? neighborhood quality? 
#because it's all the parcels, they break out differently according to different geo markers

#what levels do I think I can trust? sex_by_age_race?? then make the others assign...
#are we assigning by distance from median on the eigs? sample and match according to a sense of lots... 
#add rows of sam_sex_age, with the tract average for the HCAD values, and the likelihood of belonging within based on the sums (not quite right for apts)
#then do one by zip, one by city/sn, one by isd/HighSchool, one by Tract - then calculating ... then I get distances from the whole and do the matching trick.
#don't put in the stuff about the smallest cells at all? or put them in as totals at a larger level?....
#so, if I had city-wide, 
#with means for the missing...
#and then put them in as a lot-draw with 
#percentages from the distances calculated like preg - but for each layer, and then normalized back?

#the distribution by subcategories is flaky - I'm guessing it's the result of the statistical process of casting individuals so there are the same number
#by race in each tract. I'm thinking that each of the categories is trustworthy, but the distribution into cells introduces weirdness, even with larger cells.

#if we do the euc_distances on place_born race and place_born age, and then join them together with the HCAD so that the variation given by housing conditions
#structures the distribution???

#assign race and age from census to tract level, not individuals, in HCAD - thena PCA????
#if treat each tract as having certain characteristics, instead of the individual, and then see the variance within the tract as a way of placing individuals? save
