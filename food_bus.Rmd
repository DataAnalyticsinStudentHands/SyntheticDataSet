#Notes on where I got files
from http://pdata.hcad.org/GIS/index.html
got Parcels 2015, Hwy, School, City, Sub_poly (subdivisions), TIRZ
on 12/27/2019 got 2017 of Parcels, and most recent of others

on 7/15/2022, got 2005 (no personal property data), 2010, 2020, 2021, 2022 downloads from https://hcad.org/pdata/pdata-property-downloads.html#

got 2015 acct information from: http://pdata.hcad.org/download/2015.html - 2005 - 2020 is available.
 PP-files, real_account, and real_building
downloaded 2017 from http://pdata.hcad.org/download/2017.html on Dec. 27, 2019.

http://hcad.org/hcad-resources/hcad-appraisal-codes/
http://hcad.org/hcad-resources/hcad-appraisal-codes/hcad-building-style-codes/ also exists, but has some diffs

code descriptions for real are from: http://pdata.hcad.org/Desc/2015/code_desc_real.txt #updated https://pdata.hcad.org/data/cama/2015/code_desc_real.txt
and personal: http://pdata.hcad.org/Desc/2015/code_desc_personal.txt #updated: #https://pdata.hcad.org/data/cama/2015/code_desc_personal.txt
also exists, but has some diffs, perhaps because of year?


they also provide column names from a screenshot of their Access db: http://pdata.hcad.org/DB/Pdata_Fieldnames.pdf

Noah had things that didn't work for 2020 - they had been using the 2010 tract boundaries
Could try the crosswalk that the census provides, but since we have block level centroids, I'm just going to place them in the blocks that are there.
