# Modeling Air Pollution's Effect on Residents Living Near Major Roads

By Nicholas Nguyen

This application looks at the relationship between air pollution caused by traffic on major roads and heart disease, and was presented as a poster at the University of Houston's Undergraduate Research Day Fall 2017.

The student's original code for maps for his poster is included as PM Concentration in Urban Setting.R This code was cleaned and reorganized with map_script.R to create the maps used in the app. This app is self contained. The user should be able to run either ui.R or server.R from the appropriate working directory to display the app.
