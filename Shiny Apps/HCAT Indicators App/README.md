# HCAT Indicators App

The Housing and Urban Development program developed Healthy Community Indicators to "evaluate factors contributing to community health." More information can be found here: https://www.huduser.gov/healthycommunities/node/160058 .

This app creates side by side comparisons of some HCAT Indicators for Houston from Census Data and the citymodels Possible Houston. Further notes on the methodology for these indicators can be found here: https://www.huduser.gov/healthycommunities/sites/default/files/public/HCAT%20Administrative%20Guide_March2016.pdf
