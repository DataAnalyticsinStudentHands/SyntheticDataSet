# Project Effects of a Diabetes Prevention Program around Houston
This application uses the base model developed from U.S. Census Data and matches with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to project the number of people with prediabetes in 1 mile radius from a user specified address who could benefit from a local implementation of the CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program. The application then projects costs and savings using averages from the CDC's Diabetes Impact App. The code for the simulation can be found here: https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/SyntheticDataSet/tree/master/Potential%20Expansions/BRFSS 
The app is hosted here: http://dash.hnet.uh.edu:3838/cmupchur/diabetes_app/
