# Projected Childhood Asthma in School Zones

This application uses the base model developed from U.S. Census Data and matches with data from the Child Asthma Call Back Survey to project the number of children with uncontrolled asthma symptoms in environments with asthma triggers, and maps it by school zone. Code for the simulation is https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/SyntheticDataSet/tree/master/Potential%20Expansions/BRFSS . The finished app is hosted here: http://dash.hnet.uh.edu:3838/cmupchur/asthma_app/ .
