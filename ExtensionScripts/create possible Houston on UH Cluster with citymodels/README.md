# Possible Houston
Code to simulate Houston using the citymodels package. As it is a large simulation the scripts possible_houston_group_quarters.R and possible_houston_households.R have been written to use 10 nodes to run the simulation in parallel. These scripts to should be sourced on a supercomputer, requesting 10 nodes with the appropriate Census data available in the working directory.
