# Housing and Urban Development Program (HUD)
Data on vouchers for low income housing through the Housing and Urban Development program is available here: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/mfh/exp/mfhdiscl . This code is for matching it with the Harris County Appraisal District so variables on low income subsidized housing can be added to the model.

This project is still in progress.
